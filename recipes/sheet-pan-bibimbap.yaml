preparation:
  - name: "Vegetables"
    prep: |
      Arrange vegetables on the sheet pan, each vegetable in their own section. Make sure not to layer them, as this will prevent proper caramelization.

      Drizzle olive oil, salt and pepper, may be bit of MSG if you are being adventurous.

  - name: "Meat/Protine"
    prep: |
      I usually stir fry them, seasoning accordingly

  - name: "Rice and eggs"
    prep: |
      Make rice. Drizzle olive oil on a second sheet pan, spread rice over half. Crack egg on the other half. Cook ~5 minutes in the oven.

      Make sure not to over cook the eggs. We are looking for a very runny yolk consistency.

  - name: "Sauce"
    prep: |
      Mix gochujang, soy sauce, honey, hot sauce, sesame oil and sesame seeds in a bowl very well.

  - name: "Serving"
    prep: |
      Add rice to the bowl, add vegetables as neat pile on top, and same with meat. Cover with the egg, and add Sauce as needed.
      Mix very well with a chop-stick / spoon before digging in.

notes:
  - Vegetables with lower moisture content can be piled a bit.
  - I tried replacing rice with Buckwheat which turned out well.
  - Replaced meat with de-cased Italian sausage, was meh.
