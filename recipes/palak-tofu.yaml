    prep: |
      Heat oil in a heavy skillet/pan. Saute the onions and garlic on medium/high heat till a bit brown.

      Add the tofu in it, sprinkle salt, turmeric, red chilli powder and fry till the tofus have started to turn brown and the spices have seeped in.

      Add the mushrooms, green chillies and the garam masala and fry for a bit more, till the mushrooms have reduced a bit. Add more oil if needed.

      Add the yoghurt and mix it all well till a semi solid paste is formed.

      Finally add the spinach and some water to form a thick green gravy. Do the taste test and see what could be adjusted.

      Serve hot with either plain white basmati or parboiled rice or rotis or large toasted tortillas.
