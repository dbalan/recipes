    prep: |
      Activate dried yeast in 1 cup of 30℃ water and honey mixed together (~10 minutes)

      Mix wet ingredients into this mix, 2 eggs and 1 yolk, keep white and the other egg for topping.

      Mix dry ingredients first and then add wet ingredients to the mix. Knead very well until smooth. Add water if needed.

      Rise in a bowl covered in wet towel, ideally in an oven with light on (~40℃) for 2 hours.

      Gently deflate the dough, separate into 6 equal parts. Roll each piece into 20 cm long rope (original recipe calls for 20 inch).

      Braid the loaf (this is tough, watch some yt videos).

      Let it rise again on a baking sheet lined with baking paper — 1-1.30 hours.

      Make topping with egg white, egg and some water. Brush over the loaf, sprinkle sesame seeds.

      Bake in an oven pre-heated to 190℃, 25-30 minutes until center reads 88 ℃.
      
notes: |
  1. I have seen people add way more sugar and oil, about 8% each.
  2. Claire Saffitx have a recipe which adds tahini to the mix. https://streicker.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Honey-Tahini-Hallah.pdf
  3. Try with 50% flour, 15% honey, 10 % flavour??, 20% eggs.
