      Add cold butter to the flour, either blitz in a food processor or mix with hand to form sort of tiny globule.

      Add egg, mix with hands until everything is incorporated (do not knead). Flatten into a thick disc, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour and up-to few days.

      Roll out the dough into the shape you want.
